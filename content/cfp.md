# Progressive Data Analysis and Visualization<a id="pdav"></a>

The increasing amount of data is a long-standing challenge for data analysis systems. 
Although building interactive systems has been a central focus of the visualization community, 
when applied to large-scale data and complex algorithms, most current visualization systems suffer from 
long, unmanaged computation delays between user interactions and system responses, rendering them unusable. 
The critical challenge we face here is to make a system’s latency manageable, 
ultimately ensuring it remains below the golden limits of human latency regardless of the amount of input data and 
complexity of algorithms. 
Progressive Data Analysis and Visualization (PDAV) is a novel programming paradigm to control latency by replacing 
long computations with a series of smaller computations with bounded latency, improving iteratively until the whole 
computation is completed or until the user is satisfied with the latest iteration. 
Thus, PDAV computations also need to inform the user about the quality of the result to allow early decisions with 
controlled quality.
With PDAV, visual exploration systems can scale to large data sizes and use complex algorithms 
interactively, provided they are adapted to run progressively.
The workshop will present state-of-the-art research and work-in-progress to design and implement PDAV systems.

# Proceedings<a id="proceedings"></a>

PDAV will not have proceedings. Accepted papers will be published on the workshop website if the authors agree.
Authors are free to publish their article as a preprint, e.g., arXiv.

Accepted papers will have an oral presentation at the workshop, and also a poster slot at the IEEE VIS poster session for additional exposure and interesting discussions
