IEEE VIS is getting closer.
We hope that the hurricane will pass Tampa without too much damage and that we will be able to hold our PDAV workshop on Monday morning at the Hilton Downtown in Tampa.

If you are not attending the conference but are interested in PDAV or other VIS topics you can also attend virtually.
This year the conference is fully hybrid and you can join for only $20.

Our workshop will be on Monday Morning with two sessions from 8:30 - 9:45 and 10:15 - 11:30 AM local time.
