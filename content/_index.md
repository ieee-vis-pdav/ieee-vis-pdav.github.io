  title_small: IEEE VIS Workshop on Progressive Data Analysis and Visualization
  content: The increasing amount of data is a long-standing challenge for data analysis systems. Although building interactive systems has been a central focus of the visualization community, when applied to large-scale data and complex algorithms, most current visualization systems suffer from long, unmanaged computation delays between user interactions and system responses, rendering them unusable. The critical challenge we face here is to make a systemâ€™s latency manageable, ultimately ensuring it remains below the golden limits of human latency regardless of the amount of input data and complexity of algorithms.
