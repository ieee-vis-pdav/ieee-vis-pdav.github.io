IEEE VIS is committed to providing an inclusive and harassment-free environment in all interactions regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. This commitment extends to all IEEE VIS sponsored events and services including the PDAV workshop. As a community that aims to share ideas and freedom of thought and expression, it is essential that the interaction between attendees take place in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person by being respectful of all. IEEE VIS does not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, the use of abusive or degrading language or media, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention, and posting unwanted targeted content (e.g., cyberbullying, or content that is sexual or violent in nature).

Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of threatening behavior is encouraged to immediately report the incident to ombuds@ieeevis.org. All information shared will be kept confidential. In cases where a public response is deemed necessary, the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals consent otherwise.
